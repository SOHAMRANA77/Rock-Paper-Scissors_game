# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This Python-based Rock, Paper, Scissors game is an interactive implementation of the classic hand game. The game utilizes the Pygame library for creating an engaging graphical user interface. Users can play against the computer by selecting their move—rock, paper, or scissors—via intuitive buttons. The computer randomly generates its move, and the winner of each round is determined based on the classic rules of the game.

User and Computer Points:

Displayed scores or points for both the user and the computer, indicating the number of rounds won by each player. This provides a clear representation of the ongoing score during the game.
Game Board:

A graphical representation of the game board that dynamically updates to show the results of each round. It displays whether the user won, lost, or if the round was a tie against the computer's choice. This section enhances the interactive and competitive aspect of the game.
